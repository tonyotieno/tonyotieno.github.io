										<h3><a href="#">Project Overview</a></h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										This study examines how interlinkages between Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable
										and Clean Energy) and other SDGs manifest at the city level. Using over 10,000 indicators from 120
										Voluntary Local Reviews, a novel methodology was developed combining semantic embeddings,
										probabilistic clustering, large language models, progress scoring, and causal discovery. Sentence
										embeddings were grouped with Gaussian Mixture Models, labelled using Gemini 2.5 Flash, and
										tracked over time with normalised progress scores. Causal dependencies were inferred with the
										PC algorithm across rolling windows, with link strengths evaluated using BIC scores and stability
										tested via bootstrap resampling.

											Exploring thematic reporting with Large Language Models and Causal Discovery with Bayesian Networks

										</figure>
									<p>
										The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2015
										represented a coherent way to address the 2030 agenda by entwining diverse paradigms of
										economic, social, and environmental targets in the 17 SDGs as an ‘indivisible whole’. 
										The seventh sustainable development goal to ‘Ensure access to affordable, reliable,
										sustainable, and modern energy for all’ emerged as a key anchor for
										sustainable development in health and education, spurring industrial and economic growth, while
										having potential trade-offs with environmental sustainability, highlighting the importance of
										renewables uptake and improvements in energy efficiency.
										Despite the recognition of the integrated nature of sustainable development, most evidence of
										interlinkages is at global and national scales, with an evidence gap at the local/city scale where the
										implementation happens. Furthermore, there is a descriptive bias in the literature,
										with most studies incorporating associations, including statistical ones such as correlations, 
										and expert judgements while causal evidence of the interlinkages, however, remains
										scarce, especially for cities, presenting a challenge for urban policymakers who need directional
										insights and not just correlational ones, to prioritise interventions and avoid unintended trade-offs. 
										These challenges are further exacerbated by local-level monitoring hurdles,
										including heterogeneous indicator sets across cities and sparse time series data, which complicates
										classic econometric approaches.
									</p>

									<p>	While there are studies that have attempted to thematically cluster locally reported indicators across
										different cities, few studies have furthered the analysis by integrating the
										semantic understanding of local-level indicators with quantitative causal discovery to determine
										levers for progress and potential hurdles between different progress indicators, including energy-
										related measures of sustainable development. As such, this study aims to posit an integrative,
										data-driven pipeline to uncover plausible causal pathways among local SDG themes using city-
										reported indicators, with a focus on SDG7. More formally, the study aims to answer the following
										research questions:
										<ol>
											<li>What thematic/topical clusters of indicators related to SDG7 emerge in local-level monitoring
												and reporting?</li>
											<li>What progress have cities made in the different thematic areas of SDG7-related indicators?</li>
											<li>What are the causal mechanisms for SDG progress at the local level - what are the potential
											levers and hurdles in achieving SDG7 at the local level, and what role does the achievement of this goal play in the wider sustainable development agenda?</li>
										</ol>

											<h3>Methodology Overview</h3>

										</figure>

										<p>
											To answer the research questions, the study follows the high-level methodological pipeline outlined.
											An urban SDG corpus of over 10,000 indicators is assembled from 120 Voluntary local reviews
											(VLRs) published by 93 cities, aligning names, units, and directionality. The indicators are coherently
											clustered semantically using sentence embeddings, and Large Language Models (LLMs) are used
											to label and interpret the thematic indicator clusters (e.g., clean cooking, urban mobility). Cluster
											progress is computed using baseline-relative, direction-aware scoring at the city-year level, and
											the cluster-level panel progress scores are used to infer causal structure among clusters using
											Bayesian networks (BN), with an emphasis on SDG7. The causal links discovered are validated
											and interpreted against prior literature and urban context to identify synergies, tradeoffs, and policy
											levers. The robustness of the results is tested through sensitivity tests, including bootstrapped
											network edges.

											<h3>Results Highlights</h3>
										</header>
										<p>To visualize the clusters in the semantic space, the vector embeddings of the indicators were reduced to two dimensions
									using principal component analysis (PCA), allowing for the assessment of cluster coherence and the identification of overlapping themes across
									clusters.</p>
										<figure class="image featured">
										<a href="#">
											<img src="images/thesis/space_clusters_sdg7.png" alt="Methodology" />
										</a>
										<figcaption><strong>SDG 7 clusters in semantic space:</strong> Coherent clusters are more compact, closely
											related clusters overlap</figcaption>
										</figure>
										<p>The cluster "Energy Use, Affordability, and Efficiency" is the most coherent with closely clustered
										indicators and few overlaps with other clusters. As expected, the clusters "Renewable Energy Generation and
										Capacity", "Renewable Energy Consumption Share", and "Solar Power Generation and Capacity" are closely related
										with multiple overlaps in the semantic space. Equally as expected, the clusters "Building Energy Efficiency & Thermal
										Comfort" and "Renewable Heat Production and District Energy" have semantic overlaps.</p>
										<p>Lastly, the clusters "Household Energy Access and Poverty", "Energy Grid Performance and Modernization", and "Sustainable Urban Mobility Progress"
										are semantically clustered together, reflecting their thematic overlaps and overarching target of improving energy
										access and quality.</p>

										<figcaption><strong>Timeseries progress in SDG 7 clusters:</strong> Rates of progress calculated by fitting linear
										regression models for each indicator (subsequently aggregated to clusters) for 5-year
										time windows centered around each year from 2010 to 2020</figcaption>
										</figure>
										<p>Between 2010 and 2020, progress across SDG 7 clusters followed divergent trajectories. 
										Renewable energy consumption share and solar power generation maintained steady gains, while sustainable urban mobility showed the
										most consistent upward trend, becoming the strongest performer in 2016. Energy use, affordability and efficiency and
										energy grid performance also improved markedly after 2014. In contrast, renewable heat and district energy declined
										sharply from 2012 onward, with only marginal recovery. Building energy efficiency and thermal comfort also trended
										downward after 2016, reaching negative territory by 2020. Household energy access and renewable generation
										capacity exhibited fluctuating but modest improvements overall.</p>
