										Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are at the heart of the Paris Agreement on climate change.
										They are national climate action plans submitted by each country, outlining the efforts they intend to make to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement.
										The ‚ÄúLegal Framework‚Äù section of Kenya‚Äôs latest Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), states that the implementation of Kenya‚Äôs NDC is to be done through Kenya‚Äôs current and successive <a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/NDC/2022-06/Kenya%27s%20First%20%20NDC%20%28updated%20version%29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Climate Change Action plans (NCCAPs)</a>.
										As such, the specific target in this study is derived from Kenya‚Äôs latest NCCAP III (2023-2027). 
										Within this document, the following renewable energy targets are laid out:
									</p>
									<p> <strong>589 MW </strong> of new renewables developed <a href="https://emsi.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kenya-NCCAP-2023-2027-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by 30th June 2028, including:</a></p>
									<ul>
										<li>Geothermal - 208 MW, which is prioritised as baseload generation that is climate resilient.</li>
										<li>Wind - 161 MW.</li>
										<li>Solar - 174 MW.</li>	
									</ul>
									<p>The focus of this study is the <strong>solar target</strong> and the study‚Äôs objective is thus:</p>
									<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
  									<strong>‚ÄúTo perform a data-driven twin critique of Kenya‚Äôs target to develop 174 MW of newly installed solar capacity between 2023 (publication year of latest NCCAP) and 2028 (target year) from technological and economic lenses.‚Äù</strong>

											<h3>Methodology Overview</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											The methodological approach employed a data-driven twin critique to assess the feasibility of Kenya's <strong>174 MW</strong> solar capacity target by <strong>2028</strong> from both technological and economic lenses. 
											The study began with a comprehensive literature review to compile necessary technological (capacity, generation) and economic (project budget, timelines) data for operational, under-construction, and announced solar plants in Kenya. 
											Technological Feasibility was evaluated through two core analyses.
										</p>
										<p>	
											First, the inherent resource potential was assessed using a GIS-based analysis of mean surface solar radiation downwards (SSRD) data. 
											This resource mapping confirmed the geographical potential to meet the derived annual generation target of <strong>700 GWh</strong>. 
											Second, the historical trend in capacity additions and actual solar generation (using IEA data) was extrapolated to <strong>2028</strong>. 
											Both linear and <strong>2<sup>nd</sup></strong>-degree polynomial regression models were applied to forecast future growth, with the polynomial model specifically capturing the non-linear nature of technology adoption and capacity expansion.
										</p>
										<p>
											Economic Feasibility was assessed by calculating historical capital investment rates from the compiled project data. 
											The average historical per-MW investment rate and per-year investment rate <strong>(M USD/yr)</strong> were calculated based on the development times of existing operational projects. 
											This historical rate was then compared against the required new per-year investment rate needed to fund the targeted <strong>174 MW</strong> capacity within the <strong>5-year</strong> timeframe (<strong>2023-2028</strong>). 
											This comparison highlighted the significant required increase in annual investment.
										</p>
									
									</section>
									<section>
										<p>The total sum of installed solar capacity in Kenya that was operational by 2023 was <strong>248 MW</strong>, meaning that if Kenya was to meet her target of <strong>174 MW</strong> of new solar capacity by 2028 the total installed solar capacity would be <strong>422 MW</strong> in 2028.

										</a>
										<figcaption>Polynomial regression extrapolation of solar capacity in Kenya</figcaption>
										</figure>
										<p>Kenya is able to just about meet the target of <strong>422 MW</strong> total solar capacity in 2028 with <strong>415 MW</strong> projected under the polynomial model. 
											This indicates that based on historical solar capacity additions, Kenya has sufficient technological capacity and solar expertise in the form of contractors and developers and is therefore on track to meet the target of 422 MW by 2028.</p>

										<h3><a href="#">Project Overview</a></h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of Kenya‚Äôs target to develop 174 MW of newly installed solar capacity between 2023 and 2028. 
										This target is part of Kenya‚Äôs Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement on climate change. 
										The study uses a data-driven approach to evaluate the technical and economic aspects of achieving this target.

											<h4>Economic feasibility</h4>
											<p>
												Economic analysis revealed that the target may be too ambitious, requiring a doubling in the capital investment rate per year over the five years.
