										<h3><a href="#">Project Overview</a></h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										This study aims to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change on offshore wind generation in Great Britain, a key technology in its decarbonisation ambitions, under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios. 
										Deep Learning (LSTM) forecasting models were developed for 21 windfarms connected to the GB grid using historical climate data as predictors and hourly generation data as the target variable, from 2019-2024. 
										The models were used to predict hourly future wind generation using projected climate variables for the high (RCP 8.5) and low (RCP 2.6) emission scenarios. 
										The models forecasted similar results for both scenarios. However, the RCP 2.6 forecasts had less fluctuations indicating less variability in climate patterns in this scenario.

										The UK government has ambitious goals for offshore wind, with a capacity target of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clean-power-2030-action-plan/clean-power-2030-action-plan-a-new-era-of-clean-electricity-main-report#renewable-and-nuclear-project-delivery">43-50GW by 2030</a>, nearly double of its onshore wind capacity target. The UK has established itself as a global leader in offshore wind, second to China, with an installed capacity of <a href="https://www.renewableuk.com/news-and-resources/press-releases/global-operational-offshore-wind-capacity-grows-by-15-in-12-months-to-80-gigawatts/">96GW across 123 projects</a>, and a record generation of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3e3g9xv3ylo">83 TWh in 2024</a>.
										This project presents a novel forecasting framework to investigate the potential impacts of climate change on offshore wind generation in Great Britain by leveraging machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. Traditionally, wind power curves, which are non-linear, are used to convert wind speeds at a windfarm into power output values. The methodology in this project uses deep learning models as a proxy for these wind power curves which incorporates extra climate variables such as temperature, dew point and pressure, to predict the power generated at windfarm level.
										By training individual DL models on historical data for each windfarm and using projected climate variables given by climate simulations for different RCP forcing scenarios, the variation in future generation for offshore windfarms can be investigated for different climate scenarios. The aim is to evaluate if DL techniques can be used to forecast future offshore windfarms and if so, investigate how future generation is affected under different RCP scenarios.

											<h3>Methodology Overview</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											This study developed deep learning models to project future offshore wind generation in the UK under different climate conditions. 
											Historical wind generation data (2019-2024) was obtained from the Elexon API, using Settlement Balancing Mechanism Units (BMUs) identified through the Renewable Energy Planning Database (REPD) and the Power Station Dictionary from the UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero. 
											Corresponding historical climate variables - 10 m wind components, temperature, dewpoint, and surface pressure - were extracted from the Copernicus ERA5 reanalysis dataset.
										</p>
										<p>
											After aggregating and merging the half-hourly generation data with hourly climate data, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models were trained to predict wind generation based on these climate features. 
											Model performance was evaluated to ensure they effectively captured temporal dependencies in wind power output
										</p>
										<p>
											Finally, projected climate data from the CORDEX regional climate dataset (HadGEM2-ES and RACMO22E models) for 2026-2045 were used as inputs to the trained models. 
											This allowed the estimation of future wind generation under different climate projections, providing insights into how changing climate conditions could affect renewable energy production in the UK.
